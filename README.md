# 🐈 Cat Clicker - a playground to practice React, JS async, NodeJS 😻

I built this fun app to practice my skills! This was a great chance to refresh and strengthen my understanding of:
1. Async in JavaScript/React including timers (useEffects + setIntervals), love counts (separate per each cat! useState objects ftw), and API calls (useEffects <3)
2. Mini NodeJS backend with mySQL integration
3. React function components and props

Thanks for checking out this mini project. Feel free to fork and practice building something similar. ✨
